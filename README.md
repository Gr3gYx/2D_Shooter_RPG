2024.03.27:

After my 5 and a half years of general software engineer experience I am ready to start to conquer my dream, which is becoming a videogame developer.

This game is an example project of mine, which I started like 2 weeks ago, and I am planning to add an RPG system to this Unity 2D C# top-down shooter.

In the current state there is noisemap based random terrain generation implemented and I am using Unity's PlayerInput component, therefore it is easier to implement controller and touch inputs in case of need.
